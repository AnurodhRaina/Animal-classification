# Animal-classification
Classifying images of similar looking animals like tiger, cheetah, jaguar, and hyena into the right category. The images were obained from the exisxting database on the kaggle website. A bunch of methodologies were applied in this approach and both vanilla classsifiers and deep learning models were used finally topping it off by experimenting with the VGG16 classifier.
